# Scrap.tf-RaffleBot

A bot that enters raffles on Scrap.tf automaticly using Python's "Selenium" Library.

## Danger
Using any tool that automates raffle entering is forbidden.
I don't assume responsibility if your account gets banned for using this tool.

### Requirements
 
 1. A Windows machine.
 2. Google Chrome.
 3. Python 3.5.2 and Selenium for Python (pip install selenium) if using the script.
 4. Selenium ChromeDriver (Download here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), make sure it's in the same directory as the script.

---

### Instructions

 1. Run the script or the executable
 2. Login into Scrap.tf
 3. Optional: Write /save in the console to save the cookies so you won't have to login everytime you run the script
 4. Enter '/once' to join all raffles or '/continuously X' to join all raffles every X minutes
 5. Wait for it to do it's job, you can see the progress either in the Chrome windows or the console.
